Y'know, I see small bands on Instagram all the time. Something that really annoys me is that almost every time, they describe themselves with a genre or subgenre right off the bat. It'll be something like, "Hey, we're an up and coming shoegaze band!", or they'll string multiple genres together.

It annoys me because it seems like they put themselves in a stylistic box to hopefully grab people with the keyword. It makes me assume that they are a simple derivative of whatever style they title themselves with, that maybe they can do more but limit themselves to just the keyword.

The way I see it, you shouldn't create music to fit into a predefined box. Most, if not all, of the greatest bands to ever play didn't try to write a specific style of music; they just played their music and let the outside define it, whether placing it in an already existing genre or a brand new one.

In the modern day, it seems like we've already set every category; so I don't expect a band on Instagram to invent a new genre, but that's besides the point. Choosing to use critical thinking it becomes decently apparent that, as I've hinted at with my word choice, the use of the genre name is as a keyword for The Algorithm to grab onto. By using it, these bands hope that The Algorithm will then direct their music towards people who may be interested and choose to support them. I understand that as much as I hate the necessity of it.

With all of this said, I fear I may be assumed to be an "All modern music SUCKS!!!!111!!1!!!1!!" kind of person; and while my Spotify may corroborate with that assumption, I won't discount music just because the release date starts with two. I love Vulfpeck, and to me they differ from Instagram bands because they subscribe to my previously stated philosophy of simply making their music. You can define them with a genre, but they never did. They just wrote the music they wanted to, and the diversity in their compositions reflects that. That's what I look for and what the keywords miss for me. They seem like a death sentence to any true songwriting diversity, as they call themselves a genre, so it'll stay right there in the genre.

In some sort of conclusion; maybe I have a point, and the genre keyword can turn as many people away as it could draw in. Maybe I'm wrong, and I'm just an old man yelling at the sky that things aren't as good as the old days and that "All modern music SUCKS!!!!!!". Who knows and who cares; I know I'm reading way too far into all of this anyways.
