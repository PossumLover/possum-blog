According to doctors, therapists, and Barnes & Noble security, James writes to medicate himself, tuning the tubes and crystals of his moods with a crude hammer of underedited blog posts. He has the memory of a convict, the eyesight of a gonif, and the sensabilities of a housebreaker. The problem comes in his hours of rest, when his thoughts start blowing out the open window of his brain like pages from a printer. Sometimes it takes a paperweight to pin them down.
